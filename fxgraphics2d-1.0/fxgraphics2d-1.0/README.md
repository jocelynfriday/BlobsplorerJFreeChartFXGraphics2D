FXGraphics2D
============

Overview
--------
FXGraphics2D is a free implementation of the Graphics2D API that targets the JavaFX Canvas.  The code has been developed for the use of Orson Charts (http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/) and JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart).  The home page for the project is:

http://www.jfree.org/fxgraphics2d/

FXGraphics2D requires JDK 1.8.0 or later and is licensed under the terms of a (three clause) BSD-style license.


Demo
----
Two demos are included in the distribution.  The first shows the basic usage of the FXGraphics2D class by displaying a JFreeChart instance within a resizable JavaFX canvas.  To run this demo from the command line type the following from the root directory of the project:

    java -cp fxgraphics2d-1.0-demo.jar org.jfree.demo.fx.FXGraphics2DDemo1

The second demo is taken from the Orson Charts project and shows various 3D charts displayed on a custom JavaFX control.  The Orson Charts library is using FXGraphics2D internally for the viewer control.  To run this demo, type the following from the root directory of the project:

    java -jar fxgraphics2d-1.0-demo.jar


Build
-----
An Ant script is provided for the build.  To run it, type the following from the project root directory:

    ant -f ant/build.xml
