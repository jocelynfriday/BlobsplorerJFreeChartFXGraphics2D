Version 1.9, 6 May 2014

Overview
--------
JFreeSVG is a graphics library for the Java(tm) platform that allows you to generate content in SVG and Javascript (HTML5 Canvas) format using the standard Java2D drawing API (Graphics2D).  JFreeSVG is light-weight, fast, and has no dependencies other than the Java runtime (1.6 or later).  The home page for the project is:

    http://www.jfree.org/jfreesvg/

Version 1.0 was released on 31 July 2013 and the most recent version (1.9) was released on 6 May 2014.  Changes since the initial release are listed towards the end of this file.


Getting Started
---------------
The Javadocs for the SVGGraphics2D and CanvasGraphics2D classes give examples for typical usage, and if you are already familiar with the Java2D APIs, then all you need to do is add jfreesvg-1.9.jar to your classpath and start coding.

Oracle provides tutorials for Java2D here:

       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/

There are some demonstration applications included in the org.jfree.graphics2d.demo.* package.  These applications make use of JFreeChart, so you'll find two additional jars in the 'lib' directory (jfreechart-1.0.17.jar and jcommon-1.0.22.jar).  These are required for the demo code only.

- added support for LinearGradientPaint and improved existing GradientPaint handling;
- added KEY_ELEMENT_TITLE rendering hint;
- added support for arbitrary key, value pairs in the KEY_START_GROUP handler;
- added zeroStrokeWidth attribute to allow configuration of handling for BasicStroke with zero width (which the Java specification states should be "rendered as the thinnest possible line");
- fixed a bug in the drawImage(Image, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, ImageObserver) method.


Version 1.8 (11 April 2014)
- added additional KEY_BEGIN_GROUP options, plus special integration support for Orson Charts;
- added special handling for shape drawing when the Stroke is not an instance of BasicStroke;
- explicitly set encoding to UTF-8 for SVGUtils.writeToSVG() and SVGUtils.writeToHTML().


Version 1.7 (25 February 2014)
- added SVGHints.KEY_BEGIN_GROUP and SVGHints.KEY_END_GROUP to allow grouping of SVG output;
- fix drawString() to include id if SVGHints.KEY_ELEMENT_ID is set;
- fix transparent colors issue;
- fixed minor issue with meta tag in HTML output file.


Version 1.6 (18 December 2013)

- fixed a bug for special characters in drawString();
- fixed a bug with coordinate formatting in certain locales.


Version 1.4 (24 October 2013)
- getSVGFontStyle() now specifies font-size units as required by the SVG standard. Fixes a bug that is visible when the SVG output is rendered in FireFox (which is more strict about the standard than other browsers);

Version 1.1 (4 September 2013)
- reimplemented drawString(AttributedCharacterIterator, float, float) using TextLayout and modified drawGlyphVector() to fill rather than stroke shapes (for SVG/CanvasGraphics2D);
- removed the PDF code (to a separate project, OrsonPDF);
- fixed clipping bug in SVGGraphics2D;
